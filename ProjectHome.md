PadWiki is the way how to build offline wikipedia in less than 1 hour.

Background: When you search something on google, you'll find that the wikipedia link will show on the top 3-5 results most of the time. It indicate how import wikipedia is in the internet. Sometimes when I search something, only in the wikipedia I could find useful & enough information.

I use wikipedia to search lots of things.  And I hope that even when I have not got internet access, I could search and browse in the wikipedia,like on my itouch/iphone, on my laptop. So I created PadWiki.

OK, you may find that there is already some open source project on such topic, like wikifilter, "build fast offline wikipedia", iphone wikipedia, etc...

Dive into these project, you'll find that either it will cost you lots of diskspace or cost you lots of time to build the offline wikipedia. For the excellent project wikifilter, it allow offline browsing(without search function), it decompress the dump on local disk, currently, the English wikipedia will need more than 110GB space (oh, my God~). "build fast offline wikipedia" is very excellent on disk usage, and it leverages search engine technology(allow offline search), but it still need about halt a day(maybe 1 day) to build an offline wikipedia. (I haven't built a complete one by it yet).

Padwiki is the offline wikipedia which cost little space, only about 600MB index extra(the compressed dump of the latest English wikipedia is 5.6GB, so it would be about 6GB for a complete offline English wikipedia). It doesn't need to decompress the dump for search & browse.

And also it need less than in 1 hour to build the offline wikipedia. (Think of that, 110+GB data to be indexed less than 1 hour)

In fact the index time is less than 15 minutes.
