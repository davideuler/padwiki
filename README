PadWiki: The way how do I build offline wikipedia in less than 1 hour (2010/04)

1.Make sure you have Python, Perl, Php , Java and Django 

2.make sure the first line of Makefile is correct, like :  
XMLBZ2 = enwiki-20091103-pages-articles.xml.bz2
  make sure the bz2 file has been copied to wiki-splits directory.

3.build index
type 'make' and follow the instructions. if fail, check the file Makefile.
(whether php exists in your PATH, mywiki/show.pl will use php to parse wiki markup as nice html).

-----------------------------------------------
Built wikipedia for split already created:

$ make index 
---------------------------------------------
Start wikipedia Server :

$start.wiki.sh
